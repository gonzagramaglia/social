## Hey, I'm **[gonza](https://www.gonza.gr/)**
It's good to see that you have been interested in understanding this repository.<br><br>



I want to thank Lama Dev ([@LamaWebDev](https://twitter.com/lamaWebDev)) 
who was my guide in the development adventure of this project, 
during the **[Material UI 5 (MUI) React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzxEECHnsvU)** ðŸ¦™<br><br><br>

#### Social folder
Create project folder, open it in VSCode and open terminal

#### Project setup:
```bash
npx create-react-app .
```
(By using the period (.) after the command, you tell React to create the project in the current folder instead of creating a new folder with the name of the project)

#### File purification
Since there are several files that were created in the previous step that are not going to be used, they are removed. The src & public folders are deleted and a new ones are created.
