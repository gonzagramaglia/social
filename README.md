## Hey, I'm **[Gonza](https://www.gonza.works/)**
It's good to see that you have been interested in understanding this repository.<br><br>



I want to thank Lama Dev ([@LamaWebDev](https://twitter.com/lamaWebDev)) 
who was my guide in the development adventure of this project, 
during the **[Material UI 5 (MUI) React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzxEECHnsvU)** ðŸ¦™<br><br><br>



ðŸ“Œ **LIVE DEMO: _https://social.gonza.works/_**

#### Social folder
Create project folder, open it in VSCode and open terminal

#### Project setup:
```bash
npx create-react-app .
```
(By using the period (.) after the command, you tell React to create the project in the current folder instead of creating a new folder with the name of the project)

#### Project file purification
Since there are several files that were created in the previous step that are not going to be used, they are removed. The src & public folders are deleted and a new ones are created.

#### Dependencies that were used, along with the command to install them:

* **Material UI**
_Official website: https://mui.com/_ (suite of UI tools to help you ship new features faster)

```bash
npm install -legacy-peer-deps @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material
```
